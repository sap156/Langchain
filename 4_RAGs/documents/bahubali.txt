Title: Bahubali: The Beginning – A Tale of Destiny and Rebellion

In the ancient kingdom of Mahishmati, where mountains speak of legends and rivers whisper secrets, destiny stirs in the shadows of forgotten stories...

Prologue
Amidst the thundering monsoon rains and roaring waterfalls, a lone woman emerges from the mist, clutching a baby in her arms. Her name is Sivagami, a fierce and regal figure, wading through the turbulent river with relentless determination. As soldiers pursue her, she sacrifices herself to save the child, holding him aloft above the water even as she sinks into its depths. With her dying breath, she whispers a vow to the gods that this boy must live.

The baby is discovered by the people of a small tribal village nestled beneath the mighty waterfall. A kind couple—Sanga and her husband—adopt the boy and name him Shivudu. He grows up with the curiosity of a wanderer and the strength of a warrior, never knowing the truth of his birth.

Part I: The Climb of Destiny
Shivudu is fascinated by the towering waterfall that guards his village. No matter how many times he tries to climb it, he fails—until one day, the fire of purpose ignites in him when he finds a wooden mask, delicate and carved, that has fallen from above. Enchanted, he imagines the face it belongs to and becomes obsessed with reaching the top.

Driven by this newfound goal, Shivudu scales the waterfall with superhuman strength and perseverance. At the summit, he finds himself in an unfamiliar world—lush, dangerous, and filled with purpose. There, he meets Avantika, a rebel warrior from a secretive band resisting the cruel king Bhallaladeva, who rules the Mahishmati kingdom with tyranny.

Avantika is fierce, trained in stealth and battle. She is sworn to rescue a captive queen—Devasena—who has been imprisoned for 25 years. Shivudu, mesmerized by her courage and beauty, volunteers to take her place in the mission.

Part II: The Return of the Son
Disguised and undeterred, Shivudu infiltrates the palace and rescues Devasena. In the act, he displays a kind of skill and strength unseen for decades, catching the attention of the kingdom. When confronted, he defeats Bhallaladeva’s son, Bhadra, with ease. As Bhadra's head rolls to the palace steps, the people gasp—not at the violence, but at the uncanny resemblance between Shivudu and a long-dead hero—Amarendra Bahubali.

The story shifts.

An old slave, Kattappa, kneels before Shivudu, calling him "Baahubali", tears in his eyes. Shocked, Shivudu learns the truth: he is the son of Amarendra Baahubali, the rightful heir to the throne, who was beloved by the people and betrayed by those closest to him.

Part III: The Legend of Baahubali
In a grand flashback, the legend unfolds:

Two cousins—Amarendra Baahubali and Bhallaladeva—were raised by Queen Mother Sivagami as equals. One was kind, just, and beloved by the people—Baahubali. The other was cold, ambitious, and ruthless—Bhallaladeva. When the kingdom is threatened by a savage enemy, the Kalakeya tribe, the Queen declares that whichever prince proves himself in battle shall be crowned king.

Both cousins lead the army. Baahubali, with strategy and compassion; Bhallaladeva, with brute force. Though both are victorious, it is Baahubali who inspires the soldiers, protects the civilians, and slays the Kalakeya king. Sivagami names him the heir of Mahishmati, to the joy of the people—and the seething jealousy of Bhallaladeva and his father, Bijjaladeva.

Epilogue: The Betrayal and the Question
Kattappa, the loyal commander, ends his tale. Shivudu—Baahubali’s son—is shaken. He asks the question burning in every listener’s soul:

“If my father was so noble... so loved... so powerful... why was he killed?”

Kattappa, eyes filled with sorrow, utters the truth that stuns the world.

“Because it was I who killed him.”

The tale ends not with closure, but with a cliffhanger—an empire built on secrets, a prince reborn, and a legend just beginning.
